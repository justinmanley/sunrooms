Building Classification Tool
============================

This is a small web app which allows buildings to be quickly classified by
hand.

To run the app, type `cabal run site` at the command line and navigate to
localhost:8000 in the browser.

The easiest way to classify buildings is by using the keyboard shortcuts in
js/main.js.

TODO:
  - Add a description of the keyboard shortcuts to the UI.
